# fakebook: totally not a Facebook clone

- Post messages and links to your profile page
- View other users' profiles
- Friend users to see their posts in your feed

## Notes:

- This app is completely JavaScript-free
- Posts are always ordered from most recent to oldest
- Users listed on the directory page are ordered alphabetically
- External links must be prefixed with "http(s)://"
- Some of the code related to signing in/out is located in `app/helpers/sessions_helper.rb`
- **Passwords are NOT encrypted**

### Possible improvements:

- Including biographical information on profile pages
- Auto-prefixing of "http://" to links if needed
- Password encryption
